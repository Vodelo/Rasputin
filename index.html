		<h1>Illustration Portfolio</h1>
		<h3>A NEW CODING HOPE</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this website is to hopefully act as a digital portfolio for my current and future illustration and graphic design work.</p>
		<p>This desire has come from a life-long interest in art as a whole. From traditional Renaissance work to modern digital illustration and animation, I am all for learning about it (or at least trying to).</p>
		<h4> ME?</h4>
		<p>With my hopes and desires for this website’s future set aside, here are a few factoids about myself:<br/> 1. I am a dual citizen of the USA & Canada by means of birth (though my family currently resides in Canada). <br/> 2. I am currently a graphic design major, though I am going to attempt changing it to a Liberal Studies Major with a focus on Illustration. I may add a Communications minor. We’ll see. <br/> 3. I lived on the Graceland campus as a Hall Director’s kid for 8 years up until 2009.<br/> 4. Aside from art, I enjoy baking, hiking, playing video and board games, posing unusual questions to attempt at unusual conversations, and food in general. <br/> 5. This is my second attempt at learning html.</p>
