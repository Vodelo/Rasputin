        <h3>The Upsides</h3>
            <p>Lamoni is interesting compared to other towns. As a part of the poorest county in Iowa, the town's members work to establish a strong, familial community that tries to support one another when personal struggles arise. Having Graceland University in the town has helped pool resources into the local elementary and high schools. Students from the University have also helped contribute to the community by assisting in education programs, sustainability projects, and even business-building activities that have brought people closer together. The towns people themselves are very kind and generous, often offering a helping hand when you need it. And the land itself is beautiful. The weather shifts up and down in some extremes, but the sunsets cause by the unique weather are spectables worth seeing.</p>
        <br/><h3>THE Downsides</h3>
            <p>As stated before, Lamoni is a small community, which brings about some small issues. Due to its rough population size of about 1200 people, the town does not house any major shopping business, such as Walmart, Target, or Goodwills. This causes many people to travel at least 30 minutes north or south in order to reach such stores to purchase home items. As well, as the community is in a poor county, the infrastructure is weak. Many of the sidewalks are cracked and jagged, and there are a fair number of delapidated buildings in the downtwon area. And finally, the business the town houses mainly consist of antique stores, with limited restaurants to try and a limited variety of things you can purchase.</p>
