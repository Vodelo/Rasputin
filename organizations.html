        <br/><h1> ORGANIZATIONS</h1>
        <h3>Linden Street Coffee House</h3>
        <p>The local coffee house is the place to go for a nice lunch with friends, or a specialty caffeinated drink! With over 20 years in Lamoni, the shop has developed a menu liked by the locals and the range of university students. Local favorites include the White Zombie drink (hot or cold), the cranberry turkey sandwich, and their cinnamon rolls - heated to perfection.</p>
        <br/><h3>The Coliseum</h3>
        <p>Weekend movies at affordable prices! The Coliseum brings you a new movie each weekend, with 6pm and 8:30pm showings on Fridays and Saturdays. And did we mention that kids under 5 get in for free?</p>
        <br/><h3>Graceland University</h3>
        <p>Graceland is a unique university in many ways! From it's central "castle" building, to it's Harry Potter-like housing system, Graceland University provides a fun and supporting community to all. Whether your a prospective student, an alumni, or just someone who's interest is piqued, the school is worth seeing.</p>
        <br/><h3>Livestock Auction</h3>
        <p>Farmers from around the county often travel to the Livestock Auction to trade their livestock (and even get a donut). Stop in for Sale Day every Thursday to buy or sell cattle, and other unique animals. Don't want to leave home? The auciton also provides live bidding online. Check out their website for more information.</p>
        <br/><h3>Lamoni Community Center</h3>
        <p>This local consignement helps you get what you need on a budget, while also buying sustainably. The Community Center offers gently used clothing, kitchenwares, and a variety of miscellaneous items. If you're not sure where to find it, look for the bright pink and green building on Linden!</p>
